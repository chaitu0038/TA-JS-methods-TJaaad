#### Getting To Know String Methods

Go to this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) and look for the name of method to learn about it.

**Write in your own way of understanding (don't copy paste)**

Only if you are done with step 1 you should go ahead.

1. Practice it by yourself in console (4-5 times to understand)
2. Data types of parameters
3. Return value type
4. Write three examples
5. In your own words and one sentence explain what this method does.

Example:

1. `charAt`

   - Parameter: (index) defaults to 0 - (number data type)
   - Return: character at specific index in the string (string data type)
   - Example:
     ```js
     let name = 'Arya Stark';
     name.charAt(2); //"y"
     let sentance = 'A quick brown fox jumped over a lazy dog';
     sentance(4); // "i"
     let houseName = 'Starks';
     houseName.charAt(0); // "S"
     ```
   - `charAt` accepts a index (number data type) and return the character on that index in the string.

2. `toUpperCase` It is very straight forward anyvalue into uppercase.
3. `toLowerCase`It is very straight forward anyvalue into lowercase.
4. `trim` It will remove all the wide spaces from the start or end.
5. `trimEnd`It will remove all the wide spaces from the end.
6. `trimStart`It will remove all the wide spaces from the start.
7. `concat`It is used for concatinating multiple string value.
8. `endsWith`It returns True/False value based on wether that string endswith that specific character or value.
9. `includes`It returns True/False value based on wether the value or character is present inside that string.
10. `indexOf`It returns indexof specific character that we looking it should exist or not in the variable of the string.
11. `lastIndexOf`It same as indexof but it looks for lastindexof that specific value.
12. `padEnd`It is used add padding to the string at end.
13. `padStart`It is used add padding to the string at start.
14. `repeat`It is used for repeating the same string in multiple times.
15. `replace`It will replace a character or specific site of characters from a string.
16. `slice`It accepts 2 parameters start/end index taking out portion of string in some other way.
17. `split`It is used for spliting or string into small spaces.
18. `substring`It is used for taking out a small portion from a string.
